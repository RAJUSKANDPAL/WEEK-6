# WEEK-6   
This repository showcases the deployment of a secure three-tier architecture on Azure, consisting of Web, App, and Database subnets. The Web tier is configured to access only the App tier, while the App tier can communicate with both the Web and DB tiers. The Database tier is isolated and cannot initiate communication with the other tiers, ensuring strict access control. Only the Web tier has internet access. Each tier hosts two virtual machines — one Linux VM running Apache and one Windows VM running IIS — demonstrating cross-platform web server configuration in a controlled network environment
